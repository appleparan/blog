abstract = {This report is a part of Simson version 4.0.0, a software package that implements an efficient spectral integration technique to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible channel and boundary layer fows. The report describes how to configure, compile and install the software. Additionally, an introduction to the theory and the numerical details of the implementation is given. The solver is implemented in Fortran 77/90. The original algorithm reported in Lundbladh et al. (1992a) solved the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a channel flow geometry. That algorithm has been reimplemented in a boundary layer version of the code reported in Lundbladh et al. (1999). That allowed simulations of the flow over a flat plate. To do this an artificial free-stream boundary condition was introduced, and for spatial simulations a fringe region technique similar to that of Bertolotti et al. (1992) was implemented. In Simson the channel and boundary layer solvers have been combined together with many different features developed over the years. The code can be run either as a solver for direct numerical simulation (DNS) in which all length and time scales are resolved, or in large-eddy simulation (LES) mode where a number of different subgrid-scale models are available. The evolution of multiple passive scalars can also be computed. The code can be run with distributed or with shared memory parallelization through the Message Passing Interface (MPI) or OpenMP, respectively. The wall-parallel directions are discretized using Fourier series and the wall-normal direction using Chebyshev series. Time integration is performed using a third order Runge-Kutta method for the advective and forcing terms and a Crank-Nicolson method for the viscous terms. The basic numerical method is similar to the Fourier-Chebyshev method used by Kim et al. (1987). Further details about spectral discretizations and additional references are given in e.g. Canuto et al. (1988).},

abstract = {Galerkin (spectral) methods are explored for the numerical simulation of incompressible flows within simple boundaries. A major part of the paper is devoted to the development of transform methods for efficient simulation of flows in box geometries with periodic and free-slip boundary conditions. Techniques for incorporating known symmetries and invariances into transform methods are illustrated for the Taylor-Green vortex. Galerkin methods for accurate and efficient representation of rigid no-slip boundary conditions are also explained. A class of pseudospectral approximations is introduced in order to handle more complicated dynamical interactions in more complicated geometries. Later papers in this series will demonstrate the important advantages of spectral methods over finite-difference methods for simulation of many of the flows of current interest and will present specific numerical results for various transition and turbulent flows.},

abstract = {Galerkin (spectral) methods for numerical simulation of incompressible flows within simple boundaries are shown to possess many advantages over existing finite-difference methods. In this paper, the accuracy of Galerkin approximations obtained from truncated Fourier expansions is explored. Accuracy of simulation is tested empirically using a simple scalar-convection test problem and the Taylor–Green vortex-decay problem. It is demonstrated empirically that the Galerkin (Fourier) equations involving Np degrees of freedom, where p is the number of space dimensions, give simulations at least as accurate as finite-difference simulations involving (2N)p degrees of freedom. The theoretical basis for the improved accuracy of the Galerkin (Fourier) method is explained. In particular, the nature of aliasing errors is examined in detail. It is shown that ‘aliasing' errors need not be errors at all, but that aliasing should be avoided in flow simulations. An eigenvalue analysis of schemes for simulation of passive scalar convection supplies the mathematical basis for the improved accuracy of the Galerkin (Fourier) method. A comparison is made of the computational efficiency of Galerkin and finite-difference simulations, and a survey is given of those problems where Galerkin methods are likely to be applied most usefully. We conclude that numerical simulation of many of the flows of current interest is done most efficiently and accurately using the spectral methods advocated here. {\textcopyright} 1971, Cambridge University Press.
