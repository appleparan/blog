	abstract = {A spectral forcing scheme is developed to provide the means to obtain statistically stationary velocity fields in direct numerical simulations of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. Tests of the forcing scheme show that the details of the forcing do not have a significant effect on the small-scale structure of the velocity fields. Forced turbulent simulations are used to determine the effects of the time-step, and the spatial resolution of the grid, on the computations. Â© 1988.},
