  abstract = {Subtidal coastal sea level fluctuations affect coastal ecosystems and the consequences of destructive events such as tsunamis. We analyze a time series of subtidal fluctuations at Crescent City, California, during 1980-1991 using the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT). Our analysis shows that the variability in these fluctuations depends on the season for scales of 32 days and less. We show how the MODWT characterizes nonstationary behavior succinctly and how this characterization can be used to improve forecasts of inundation during tsunamis and storm surges. We provide pseudocode and enough details so that data analysts in other disciplines can readily apply MODWT analysis to other nonstationary time series.}

  abstract = {Wavelets are new families of basis functions that yield the representation \$f(x) = \textbackslash sum \{b\_\{jk\} W(2\^j x - k)\} \$. Their construction begins with the solution \$\textbackslash phi (x)\$ to a dilation equation with coefficients \$c\_k \$. Then W comes from \$\textbackslash phi \$, and the basis comes by translation and dilation of W. It is shown in Part 1 how conditions on the \$c\_k \$ lead to approximation properties and orthogonality properties of the wavelets. Part 2 describes the recursive algorithms (also based on the \$c\_k \$) that decompose and reconstruct f. The object of wavelets is to localize as far as possible in both time and frequency, with efficient algorithms},

  abstract = {This note is a very basic introduction to wavelets. It starts with an orthogonal basis of piecewise constant functions, constructed by dilation and translation. The "wavelet transform" maps each f(x) to its coefficients with respect to this basis. The mathematics is simple and the transform is fast (faster than the Fast Fourier Transform, which we briefly explain), but approximation by piecewise constants is poor. To improve this first wavelet, we are led to dilation equations and their unusual solutions. Higher-order wavelets are constructed, and it is surprisingly quick to compute with them — always indirectly and recursively.},

  abstract = {Multiscale analysis of univariate time series has appeared in the literature at an ever increasing rate. Here we introduce the multiscale analysis of covariance between two time series using the discrete wavelet transform. The wavelet covariance and wavelet correlation are defined and applied to this problem as an alternative to traditional cross-spectrum analysis. The wavelet covariance is shown to decompose the covariance between two stationary processes on a scale by scale basis. Asymptotic normality is established for estimators of the wavelet covariance and correlation. Both quantities are generalized into the wavelet cross covariance and cross correlation in order to investigate possible lead/lag relationships. A thorough analysis of interannual variability for the Madden-Julian oscillation is performed using a 35+ year record of daily station pressure series. The time localization of the discrete wavelet transform allows the subseries, which are associated with specific physical time scales, to be partitioned into both seasonal periods (such as summer and winter) and also according to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity. Differences in variance and correlation between these periods may then be firmly established through statistical hypothesis testing. The daily station pressure series used here show clear evidence of increased variance and correlation in winter across Fourier periods of 16–128 days. During warm episodes of ENSO activity, a reduced variance is observed across Fourier periods of 8–512 days for the station pressure series from Truk Island and little or no correlation between station pressure series for the same periods.},
