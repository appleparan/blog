	abstract = {Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis ({WGCNA}) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.},

	abstract = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion). We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.},

	abstract = {Spatially or chemically isolated functional modules composed of several cellular components and carrying discrete functions are considered fundamental building blocks of cellular organization, but their presence in highly integrated biochemical networks lacks quantitative support. Here, we show that the metabolic networks of 43 distinct organisms are organized into many small, highly connected topologic modules that combine in a hierarchical manner into larger, less cohesive units, with their number and degree of clustering following a power law. Within Escherichia coli, the uncovered hierarchical modularity closely overlaps with known metabolic functions. The identified network architecture may be generic to system-level cellular organization.},
